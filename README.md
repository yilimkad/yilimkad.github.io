### STA141B Project

<a href="http://cjacquelineq.github.io/STA141B-Project-House-Price/STA+141B+Project+House+Price.html">Race, School Ratings, and Real Estate: What affects home price in California? </a>

When it comes to home buying market, people usually need to consider many characteristics of the house, such as number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, garage, backyard, etc. However, there are actually much more factors need to be thought about beyond the house itself. For example, public school ratings and crime situation. Accroding to a national study conducted in 2013, public school ratings in the district can affect the homes' values, which leads to an average premium of $50 a square foot. Besides, racial composition of the neighborhood also influence home buyers' decisions. For most of the time, school ratings and racial composition interact with each other and mutually pose impact on real estate price. 
This project focuses on researching the relationship between public school rating and racial composition and their influences in home prices. We examine the crime occurrence and house price. By the end, web scraping is used to predict the trend of the house price.
