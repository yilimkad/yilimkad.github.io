My name is Yili Wang, a fourth-year Applied Statistics student at UC Davis with expected graduation in December 2017. I am from Beijing and my hobbies are playing tennis and stock investment (even though I lose a lot.. but I am still optimistic about the market!). I am passionate about programming in python and I am want to seek for a career in Quantatitive Finance. 

Here are some projects I did. I hope these will make you feel how amazing the programming world is! 
Enjoy!
